### Syntax

- RPC put method name and parameters into the transfer body; 
- Rest put method in the URL and parameter in the body

### What are they for

- RPC-based APIs are great for actions
- REST-based APIs are great for modeling your domain
BTW, compared with put, patch will only update the parameter provided. It is generally idempotent
